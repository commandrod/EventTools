# EventTools

Fully customisable recreation of Skeppy's EventTools plugin, with more features.

## Features

### Handlers

Handlers can be toggled in the config. If a handler is disabled, its listener will not be registed.
They are used to stop the plugin from interrupting others when there are no events running!

### Other

 - Toggle chat
 - View messages when chat is muted
 - Toggle PvP
 - Spawn management
