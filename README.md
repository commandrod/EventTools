# EventTools

Fully customisable recreation of Skeppy's EventTools plugin, with more features.

## Features

### Handlers

Handlers can be toggled in the config. If a handler is disabled, its listener will not be registed.
They are used to stop the plugin from interrupting others when there are no events running!

### Bypasses

Bypasses give an administrator the ability to bypass a handler's restrictions. For example, if a player has
a PvP bypass, he could punch other players. This feature has been added due to [Skeppy's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCFPY2HUn2g).
Bypasses can be given to players with the command <code>/bypass <bypass> [player]</code><br>
You could also give players access to a certain bypass via giving them the permission <code>EventTools.bypass.\<bypass-name></code>
